# Heart-Disease-Detection
This study uses AI algorithms (XGBoost, LSTM, Transformer) and a hybrid model (XGBoost-LSTM) to improve heart disease diagnosis accuracy. Using EEG signals and patient details, the hybrid model achieved a 90% accuracy, showcasing the potential of ensemble learning for early detection and treatment.
